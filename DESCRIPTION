Description: This package implements the Globorisk risk calculator. Globorisk is
    the first cardiovascular disease risk score that predicts risk of heart attack 
    or stroke in healthy individuals (those who havenot yet had a heart attack or 
    stroke) for all countries in the world. It uses information on a personâ€™s
    country of residence, age, sex, smoking, diabetes, blood pressure and 
    cholesterol to predict the chance that they would have a heart attack or stroke
    in the next 10 years. If the person does not have a recent diabetes or 
    cholesterol test, they can use the office-based version of Globorisk which is
    based on body weight and height instead.
